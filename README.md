# lab-database

This program was made for my sister to store her lab data and keep track of her lab reports.
It was programmed in Java on Eclipse. I wanted to focus on including the Object Oriented Concepts that I learnt to keep methods reusable as this was my first bigger project. The planning stage took about a month or two as I was asking/interviewing my sister whilst also planning the UI, the types of non-standard algorithms that I wanted to create, and researching how to connect this to a database.
